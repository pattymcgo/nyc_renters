# NYC Renters
## About the Project
This project analyzes renters in **New York City, New York** using 2023 Census microdata and R programming language.
Using get_pums() allows us to assess demographic relationships at the individual level using PUMS (Public Use Microdata Sample) of the American Community Survey (ACS) that is not possible with aggregate data downloaded. 
"PUMA" refers to the microdata area code. "PINCP" refers to a person's total income. "COW" refers to class of worker, like private worker, government worker, or self-employed worker. "INDP" refers to the industry code. "GRPIP" refers to gross rent as a percentage of a person's income. "TEN = 3" indicates a filter for renters only.
PUMA codes are defined on this website: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/PUMA#codes_section
Industry code definitions are defined here: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/IND#codes_section.
